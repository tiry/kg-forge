# `kg-forge` — Knowledge Graph CLI Toolkit

`kg-forge` is an experimental command-line tool for building, querying, and visualizing a lightweight **Knowledge Graph** generated from a folder of HTML documents (such as a Confluence HTML export).

It provides a pluggable architecture for entity extraction, ontology definition, graph storage, and visualization.


## 🚀 Project Goals

This project is designed as an end-to-end experimental environment to answer questions such as:

* How do we extract **meaningful entities** and **topics** from text using LLMs?
* What is the best approach to **store, merge, prune, and evolve** a Knowledge Graph?
* How do we define and maintain a useful **ontology**?
* How can this pipeline later be mapped to Hyland **KnowledgeEnrichment** APIs and Content Lake?
